## Data Access

The large `.h5ad` dataset used in this project is not included in the repository due to its size (~10GB).

You can manually download it from:

- [AIDA Phase 1 Data Freeze v1](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/ced320a1-29f3-47c1-a735-513c7084d508)

Place the downloaded file in the **data** folder and rename it to ***AIDA.h5ad***.
